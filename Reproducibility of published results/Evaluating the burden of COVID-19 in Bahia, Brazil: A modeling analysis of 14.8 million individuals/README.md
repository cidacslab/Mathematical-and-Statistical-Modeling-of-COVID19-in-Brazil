## General info
In this folder the reader can find the code used to produce the results in the manuscript (preprint [1]) entitled "Evaluating the burden of COVID-19 in Bahia, Brazil: A modeling analysis of 14.8 million individuals".

## Compilation
We performed our analysis using Python version 3. 

## Input data

The models produced in this study were informed by data from multiple sources: The daily series of the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases and the daily mortality series for the state of Bahia, its capital Salvador and the remaining cities were obtained from [publicly available data](http://www.saude.ba.gov.br/temasdesaude/coronavirus/notas-tecnicas-e-boletins-epidemiologicos-covid-19/) provided by the Secretary of Health of the State of Bahia (SESAB). Throughout our analyses we consider separately the state capital (which concentrates the number of cases in the region) and the remaining 416 state municipalities. Data was available throughout the period of March 6 to May 4, 2020.
