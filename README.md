# Mathematical and Statistical Modeling of COVID19 in Brazil                               


A library for compartimental models to understand the spread of transmission diseases focus on the spread of COVID19 in Brazil.  The library also provide detailed informations to reproduce all published results (accepted or preprint) in the folder "Reproducibility of published results".


# Getting started

## If you like to:

 - Learn about the models used herein [Description](docs/Mathematical%20and%20Statistical%20Modeling%20of%20COVID19%20in%20Brazil.ipynb)
 - See how it works in pratice [Painel Covid-19](http://covid19br.org/)
 - Learn by doing 
     - [A simple SIR computaion](/tutorials/SIR.ipynb)

 
 
# Installation

Currently the library is on production, so the easiest way to use is clone our repository or copy the functions avaliable [here](/main/modelos.py)


# Dependencies

Models were implemented using Python > 3.5 and depend on libraries such as [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), etc. For the full list of dependencies as well libraries versions check requirements.txt.
